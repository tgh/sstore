Assignment 1 - Testing document

In order to test the driver, I wrote two small programs called test_first and 
test_second.  The first writes data to the device, along with a read thrown in.
It then calls a read that blocks.  test_second is then run which eventually
writes to the position that test_first is waiting for.  It wakes and continues.
Both throw in a couple ioctl delete calls as well as some erroneous calls,
like writing to a blob index greater than the max blob parameter, or deleting
a non-existent blob.

See typescript for the output, as well as dmesg.txt for the kernel debug output
during execution.
