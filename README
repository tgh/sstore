Assignment 1 - Sstore Device Driver


OVERVIEW
--------
The sstore device is a storage device that holds a linear linked list of blobs.
Each blob contains an integer representing it's index, a dynamically allocated
array of chars to hold arbitrary data, and a next blob pointer.  I should have
implemented it as a doubly linked list, making deletion and seeking easier, but
too late now.


USING THE DRIVER
----------------
To compile the driver, use the Makefile by running (as root):

$ make -C [path of kernel source tree root] M=`pwd` modules

Then, run the sstore_load script (as root).  You can now use your own program
to use the sstore device, or run the test_first and test_second programs.  There
is no Makefile for these, but all you need to do is run

$ gcc -o test1 test_first.c
$ gcc -o test2 test_second.c

There are two in order to test concurrency.  By the names, you can guess that
you should run test_first before test_second, in order to test concurrency.
test_first will block on a read, and test_second will do a write that wakes the
first up and let's it continue.  Each test also breaks in between each operation
by waiting for the user to enter 'c' before continuing.  That way the user can
use another process to read the /proc files (see below) if (s)he so wishes.  The
tests just do basic operations with arbitrary data.  If time permitted I would
have created a interactive program that allowed the user to make reads, writes,
and deletions at runtime.


API/OPERATIONS
--------------
This driver supports reads and writes (of course), as well as one ioctl command
for deleting a blob by index.

During a read, if a blob doesn't exist at the given index (and the index is
valid), or there is no data inside the blob (data pointer is NULL), then the
process/thread blocks and waits for data to appear there.

The write routine will allocate empty blobs if the given index to write to is
beyond the end of the list (but less than the maximum blobs allowed, of course).
If, on the other hand, a blob is there, and data has already been stored there,
then the previous data is freed, and new space is kmalloced accordingly for the
new data being written.

When a write is successful, those readers waiting on the wait queue will be
awakened, in which case they recheck the condition they were waiting on.

The sstore structure that represents the device contains an open file count, a
blob count, a wait queue, a blob list, a blob pointer acting as a seek pointer
in the list, a mutex lock, and a cdev structure.  Any code referencing these
variables is critical and is kept under the mutex lock.

To use ioctl, use must include the sstore header file for the command.  It is
SSTORE_IOCTL_DELETE.  When there is no blob at the given index to delete, a
-EINVAL is returned.  An errno of -ENOBLOB would be better...


/proc FILES
-----------
This device initializes two /proc files: sstore/data, and sstore/stats.  data
will spit out the data contents of the blobs in all open devices.  stats will
report the open file count, blob count, and the index of where the blob seek
pointer is in the list.
